# TCGA-Assembler 2

TCGA-Assembler 2 is an open-source, freely available tool that automatically downloads, assembles and processes public The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) data of TCGA samples. It facilitates downstream data analysis by relieving investigators from the burdens of data preparation. TCGA-Assembler 2 includes two modules. Module A acquires public TCGA data from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) of the U.S. National Cancer Institute and assembles individual data files into locally stored data tables. It can also acquire mass spectrometry proteomics data of TCGA samples generated by the CPTAC. Module B fulfills various data processing needs to prepare them for downstream analysis. TCGA-Assembler 2 is licensed under the GPL version 3 and can be distributed under GPL version 3.
